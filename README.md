# lorenz_cipher
Lorenz stream cipher implementation in c

## Problem definition

Implement the Lorenz cipher (using C language) to perform following functions:

1. Read any Wikipedia page with more than 1000 words encoded in ASCII.
2. Convert the page by re-encoding it in Baudot code.
3. Encrypt the contents using the Lorenz keystream generator given in the slides as an example.
4. Compute the number of bits from the input plaintext that was changed in the ciphertext as a percentage.
